UMN Data Analytics Bootcamp Homework 17

Tools Used:

* Javascript
* Leaflet
* HTML
* CSS


### Assignment Overview

* Using data provided from the USGS provided at the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page, select a data set to visualize. When you click on a data set, for example 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days', you will be given a JSON representation of that data. Use the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for our visualization.

* Create a map using Leaflet and plot all the earthquakes in the dataset selected based on longitude and latitude.

* The markers for each earthquake should reflect the magnitude by size and depth by color.

* Include popups with additional information when an earthquake is selected.
